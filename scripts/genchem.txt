1. A container filled with fluorine gas and neon gas and has a total pressure of 8atm. There are 50g of fluorine gas in the container, and the fluorine gas exerts a pressure of 5atm.
Based on this, what is the mass of neon in the container? 15.9g

2. 2.0mol of an ideal gas are contained in a 3.0L container at a temperature of 25∘C. The gas exerts a pressure of 16atm on the container. If pressure is kept constant, what is the final volume of the gas if the temperature of the container is increased to  200∘C?
